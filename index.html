                <h2>Navigating the Pandemic</h2>
                <p>A restaurant industry ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. Diners greeted by closed doors as local businesses adapt to the necessary social distancing guidelines imposed by public health officials. A spike in social media activity within communities dedicated to home cooking. COVID-19 has undoubtedly brought about changes to what people are eating and from where that food is being served.</p>
                <p>As an Orange County native, seeing this place I call home make national headlines for a whole host of embarrassing behaviors stemming from anti-mask sentiments has been disheartening and humiliating to say the least. From anti-maskers seizing control of a board meeting to complain about the oppression committed by face masks to chief health officials reducing the mandatory mask-wearing guideline to a mere recommendation, the history of Orange County’s pandemic response is bleak. It is for these reasons that coronavirus is still a relevant danger that continues to shape the way we go about our daily lives—including how and what we eat.</p>

                <h2>Becoming a Home Cooking Hobbyist</h2>
                <p>Even early on in the pandemic, supermarket shelves were being wiped of yeast packets and sacks of flour as people flocked to their kitchens to bake bread loaves from scratch. A yeasty carb lover myself, I had been hoping to knead my way to sourdough and cinnamon roll heaven at home. However, I came home yeast-less on multiple occasions, confronted by the sad reality of universally out-of-stock staples.</p>
                <p>From this story alone, it can be argued that one of the most evident ways our food and consumption habits have changed as a result of the pandemic is the shift to making and eating home cooked food. This much has been made clear by the explosive popularity of FaceBook groups like Subtle Asian Cooking, where members post anything from an amateur baker's first time making milk bread to a loving mom's drive to drop off 2 weeks worth of meal-prepped lunches at her son's apartment. As for me, I’ve been in the kitchen every day since quarantine, trying new recipes and dishing up foods I normally wouldn’t have the time to prepare.</p>

                <h2>Conscious Consumption: Supporting Local Black & Immigrant-Owned Businesses</h2>
                <p>Beyond just self-discovery and conversion to home-cook hobbyists, the pandemic has invited widespread awareness of the need to support struggling local businesses—especially Black and immigrant-owned ones. Xenophobic rhetoric encouraged the abandonment of Chinatowns and Asian restaurants within an already decimated food landscape.</p>
                <p>There’s even more to be said of the need to support Black communities and businesses. For one, the pandemic has been disproportionately ripping through under-resourced Black and indigenous communities. This issue is rooted in housing and healthcare disparities created by systemic racism swept under the rug by the country’s leadership; as such, it wouldn't be an overstatement to say that said leaders have deliberately primed the pandemic to sweep across Black and minority communities. This speaks volumes to the apathy toward Black and minority lives exhibited by the Administrastion. Food is an avenue for us to support these communities as patrons of their businesses.This knowledge, coupled with the vigor of the BLM movement and its raw depiction of systemic racism, has triggered many to feel the need to support Black-owned businesses more deeply and urgently than ever before.</p>
                <p>The popularity of #supportblackbusinesses and #supportlocal are a testament to the public's conscious efforts to be mindful of where their money is going when ordering takeout or delivery.</p>
                <p>With that said, every person’s experience of navigating the pandemic is still unique. I wanted to hear from a close friend about how her food and consumption habits have been impacted by the combined forces of the pandemic and social justice movements.</p>
